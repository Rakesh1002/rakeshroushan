# Inbox

Everything starts here. Capture fast, process during daily review.

## Rules

1. **Capture anything** — ideas, tasks, notes, links
2. **Process daily** — move to the right place or delete
3. **Keep empty** — inbox zero = peace of mind

## Processing actions

- **Delete** — not worth your time
- **Delegate** — assign to someone else
- **Defer** — schedule for later (add to calendar/project)
- **Do** — takes <5 min? Do it now
- **Document** — belongs in a project/brand/ops folder

## Quick capture
