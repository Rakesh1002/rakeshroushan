# About

I’m Rakesh Roushan. I help founders and product leaders build **AI-native products** and scale execution using **first-principles strategy**, **operating cadence**, and **compounding distribution**.

## What I’m known for (pillars)

- CEO systems: one inbox, one scoreboard, one cadence
- AI product leadership: durable products, not demos
- India-scale execution: constraints, distribution, and real-world learnings

## Working with me

If you’re building an AI product (or scaling one), I can help with:

- Product strategy + roadmap under uncertainty
- Execution systems (scoreboards, weekly reviews, decision memos)
- Distribution thinking and go-to-market clarity
