# Automation

Automation should do two things:

1) **Reduce friction** for behaviors you already want (publishing, reporting, syncing docs).
2) **Enforce consistency** (templates, scoreboards, naming).

## Current scripts

- `scripts/sync-web-content.mjs`: sync `os/public/` (and selected OS artifacts) into `web/rr/content/`

## Next automations (suggested)

- Weekly reminders: generate checklists and open issues (GitHub) for weekly review
- Content publishing: export calendar rows → drafts folder per channel
- Startup reporting: compile weekly updates into a single portfolio report
