# The Architect of Influence: A Strategic Roadmap for Rakesh Roushan


## Part I: Executive Summary & Strategic Vision


### A. The Mandate

This report outlines a comprehensive, 24-month personal branding, content, and monetization strategy for Rakesh Roushan. The primary objective is to transition Mr. Roushan from a successful corporate product leader into a preeminent, publicly recognized thought leader at the intersection of Product Management, Generative AI, and high-growth technology in the Indian market. The strategy is designed to systematically build authority, amplify influence, and create diversified, high-margin revenue streams that extend beyond traditional employment.


### B. The Vision: "The Strategic PM for India's AI Future"

The end state of this engagement is to establish Mr. Roushan as the go-to expert for founders, venture capitalists, and aspiring product managers on the specific challenges and opportunities of building and scaling AI-native products for the Indian ecosystem. This brand will be uniquely positioned and characterized by three core pillars: strategic depth, evidenced by his IIM Calcutta pedigree <sup>1</sup>; practical, high-scale execution, demonstrated by over 12 years of experience at prominent companies like Paytm and SatSure <sup>1</sup>; and forward-looking technological expertise, with a sharp focus on Generative AI.<sup>1</sup> This vision aims to carve out a distinct and valuable niche in a competitive thought leadership landscape.


### C. Core Challenges Identified

A thorough analysis of Mr. Roushan's current digital footprint and the broader market reveals three critical challenges that must be addressed to achieve the stated vision:



1. **Brand Dilution & Anonymity:** The digital identity of "Rakesh Roushan" (and its common variant "Roshan") is severely diluted. Search engine results are saturated with numerous other professionals, including a well-known film director, a cricket coach, an Ayurveda professor, and various software engineers and project managers.<sup>4</sup> This creates a significant signal-to-noise problem, making it difficult for his target audience to discover and correctly identify him, thereby hindering brand recognition and authority building from the outset.
2. **Underdeveloped Digital Infrastructure:** The current state of Mr. Roushan's digital assets is a major liability. His personal website, rakeshroushan.com, is inaccessible, which represents a critical failure in controlling his own brand narrative and a significant detractor from his credibility as a tech leader.<sup>12</sup> Furthermore, his LinkedIn profile, while containing impressive credentials, is structured as a historical resume rather than a dynamic platform for thought leadership.
3. **Lack of a Cohesive Public Narrative:** While the career trajectory detailed on his professional profiles is impressive, it lacks a unifying public-facing "thesis".<sup>1</sup> There is no clearly articulated point of view that answers the fundamental question for his audience: "What does Rakesh Roushan stand for, and why should I listen to him?" His expertise is implicit in his experience but has not been translated into an explicit, compelling brand story.


### D. The Strategic Response - A Four-Phase Approach

To overcome these challenges and realize the brand vision, this report proposes a structured, four-phase strategic roadmap:



1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3):** Fortify the digital identity to combat brand dilution, meticulously define the core brand message and value proposition, and establish a central, owned content hub (the personal website) to serve as the single source of truth.
2. **Phase 2: Authority (Months 3-12):** Build foundational credibility and cultivate an initial audience by executing a consistent, high-value content engine across targeted platforms, establishing expertise within the defined content pillars.
3. **Phase 3: Amplification (Months 6-18):** Leverage the established authority to gain access to external platforms ("Other People's Audiences"), such as podcasts and industry publications, and begin the transition from a content creator to a community builder.
4. **Phase 4: Monetization (Months 12-24+):** Systematically convert the accumulated influence and expertise into diversified and scalable revenue streams, moving from services to products over time.


### E. Anticipated Outcomes

Successful execution of this 24-month roadmap is projected to yield significant professional and financial returns. Anticipated outcomes include a marked increase in inbound, high-caliber career opportunities such as board seats and advisory roles; the development of a strong pipeline for high-ticket consulting and coaching engagements; the creation of scalable revenue from knowledge products like online courses and paid communities; and the cultivation of a powerful professional network that solidifies long-term career resilience, impact, and legacy in the Indian technology landscape.


## Part II: Phase 1 - Brand Foundation & Digital Identity Fortification (Months 1-3)


### A. Audit of Current Digital Footprint: The Accomplished Professional

The initial phase of any brand transformation begins with a candid assessment of the existing assets and liabilities. Mr. Roushan's current digital presence is a study in contrasts: his professional qualifications are elite, yet his public-facing infrastructure is either underdeveloped or non-functional.


#### LinkedIn Analysis

Mr. Roushan's LinkedIn profile serves as the primary source of his current professional identity.<sup>1</sup>



* **Strengths:** The profile effectively communicates a history of high achievement. The educational background from IIM Calcutta immediately signals a high level of strategic and business acumen.<sup>2</sup> The career path shows a clear upward trajectory, featuring roles at recognizable and respected companies such as Paytm and Absolute®, culminating in senior leadership positions like Head of Product and Director.<sup>1</sup> A comprehensive list of certifications in SAFe, Scrum, AI, and prompt engineering demonstrates a laudable commitment to continuous professional development and relevance in a fast-moving industry.<sup>1</sup>
* **Weaknesses:** The profile's primary weakness is its positioning. It reads as a static curriculum vitae, designed for recruiters, rather than a dynamic platform for thought leadership. The headline, "Product Leader | IIM Calutta | GenAI | Building products loved by millions," is a solid foundation but lacks a unique, compelling point of view that differentiates him from thousands of other product leaders. The profile is a record of past accomplishments, not a destination for future insights.


#### Website Analysis

The status of the personal website, rakeshroushan.com, is a critical and immediate concern. Multiple attempts to access the site have confirmed that it is inaccessible.<sup>12</sup> For a leader in the technology and product space, a non-functional personal website is more than a missed opportunity; it is a significant blow to credibility. It suggests a lack of attention to his own "product"—his professional brand—and undermines the very expertise he claims. It cedes control of his narrative to third-party platforms and search engine algorithms.


#### The Brand Dilution Crisis

A fundamental obstacle is the severe dilution of the name "Rakesh Roushan" in the digital sphere. Search queries for his name are dominated by a host of other individuals, most notably the famous Indian film director Rakesh Roshan, but also a cricket coach, an Ayurveda professor, a technical delivery manager in Berlin, and numerous other software developers and consultants.<sup>4</sup> This is the single greatest immediate threat to building a recognizable personal brand, as it creates a high barrier to discovery for his intended audience.

This situation creates a credibility paradox. On one hand, Mr. Roushan's credentials, as listed on platforms like Board Infinity and Mentoring Club, are top-tier and suggest a highly credible professional.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand, his owned digital infrastructure is broken, and his name is lost in a sea of search results. This disconnect presents a jarring experience for anyone attempting to vet him online, be it a recruiter, a potential client, a conference organizer, or a founder seeking an advisor. The broken website is not merely a technical glitch; it is a brand statement that communicates a lack of attention to detail regarding his own professional identity. Therefore, the first strategic priority is not content creation but foundational repair. Building a thought leadership platform on a broken foundation is an exercise in futility. Trust must be established at the most basic level of digital presence before any attempt at higher-level influence can succeed.


### B. Defining Brand 2.0: The Strategic PM for India's AI Future

To cut through the noise and establish a clear, authoritative presence, a new brand identity must be meticulously crafted. This identity must be unique, defensible, and compelling, providing a clear answer to the question, "Why Rakesh Roushan?"


#### Core Thesis Formulation

The brand's intellectual foundation will be its core thesis. This is the central idea that will underpin all content and communication. The proposed thesis is: *"I help Indian startups and scale-ups navigate the 0-to-1 and 1-to-100 journey of building market-defining, AI-powered products by applying strategic frameworks learned at IIM and battle-tested at companies like Paytm."* This statement is specific, highlights his unique combination of skills, and directly addresses the pain points of his target audience.

Brief: I partner with global startups and SMEs, leveraging strategic frameworks and practical experience at companies like Paytm & Airtel, to guide them through the 0-to-1 and 1-to-100 stages of developing market-defining, AI-powered products.

One-liner: I Partner with global startups to build market-defining, AI-powered products..


#### Target Audience Personas

A successful brand is built for a specific audience. The strategy will focus on three key personas:



1. **The Aspiring PM (Early Career):** This individual is in the first 1-5 years of their product career. They are seeking tactical advice, proven frameworks, career roadmaps, and mentorship from a seasoned leader who has navigated the path they are on.
2. **The Mid-Career PM (Peer):** This persona is a Product Manager, Senior PM, or Group PM with 5-10 years of experience. They are looking for advanced strategic frameworks, leadership insights to help them transition into management, and a community of practice to discuss complex challenges.
3. **The Founder/VC (Client/Partner):** This group includes early-stage tech founders and the venture capitalists who fund them. They are searching for expert advisors, fractional Chief Product Officers (CPOs), and credible thought leaders who possess a deep understanding of the Indian market, product scaling, and the application of new technologies like GenAI.


#### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Mr. Roushan's brand will be positioned at the powerful intersection of three distinct and valuable domains: **(1) Elite Strategic Acumen (IIM Calcutta)**, which provides a foundation of rigorous, first-principles thinking; **(2) High-Scale Execution in India (Paytm, etc.)**, which demonstrates the ability to apply theory in the complex, fast-paced Indian market; and **(3) Future-Facing Tech Expertise (GenAI)**, which signals relevance and forward-looking value. This combination creates a defensible niche that very few professionals can legitimately claim.

The name "Rakesh Roushan" is currently a brand liability due to the aforementioned search conflicts.<sup>4</sup> Attempting to outrank a famous film director through traditional SEO is a costly, long-term, and likely losing battle. The more effective strategy is to reframe the search query itself. By consistently associating his name with a unique professional identifier, he can create a new, uncontested search space. This requires the adoption of a consistent professional moniker across all platforms. Options include using a middle initial (e.g., "Rakesh K. Roushan") or, more powerfully, a descriptive tagline such as "Rakesh Roushan (The GenAI PM)". This chosen moniker must be deployed universally—in his LinkedIn URL and headline, the title tag of his website, his X (formerly Twitter) bio, and in all speaker introductions. This disciplined approach will train both search engine algorithms and his human audience to associate him with this unique, professional identity, effectively solving the brand dilution crisis.


### C. Digital Infrastructure Overhaul: Building the Brand Hub

With a clearly defined brand strategy, the next step is to build the digital infrastructure to support it. This involves a complete overhaul of his existing assets.


#### LinkedIn Profile Optimization

LinkedIn will be the primary social platform for projecting professional authority. The following optimizations are required immediately:



* **New Headline:** The headline must be transformed into a concise value proposition. A recommended revision is: *"Head of Product | IIM Calcutta | I build market-leading AI products for India's next billion users. | Ex-Paytm, SatSure"*
* **Custom URL:** To begin the process of differentiation, a custom URL should be secured, such as linkedin.com/in/rakeshroushanpm or a similar variant that incorporates his professional focus.
* **"About" Section Rewrite:** This section must be rewritten from a third-person resume summary into a first-person brand manifesto. It should tell his professional story, articulate his core thesis, and clearly state who he helps (his target audience) and how he helps them (his UVP).
* **Featured Section:** This prime real estate on the profile must be immediately populated. It should feature prominent links to his new personal website, a "Work With Me" or "Services" page, and his first foundational pieces of thought leadership content.


#### Personal Website (rakeshroushan.com) Relaunch

The personal website must be resurrected with urgency. It will serve as the central, owned hub for his brand—the ultimate source of truth that he controls completely.



* **Objective:** The website's primary function is to establish credibility, house his thought leadership, and serve as the main conversion point for his audience (e.g., newsletter sign-ups, contact for services).
* **Key Sections:**
    * **Home:** A clean, professional design with an "above-the-fold" headline that clearly communicates his Unique Value Proposition.
    * **About:** A comprehensive narrative of his professional journey, his core beliefs about product management, and his vision for the future of tech in India.
    * **Blog/Articles:** This will be the home for his long-form, evergreen thought leadership content.
    * **Services:** A clearly defined page outlining his future offerings, such as Speaking, Advisory, and Coaching. Initially, this can be a simple "Work With Me" page with a contact form.
    * **Press/Media Kit:** A dedicated page for public relations purposes. This should include a professional bio of varying lengths, high-resolution headshots, and links to any media appearances or publications.
    * **Contact/Newsletter Signup:** A clear and persistent call-to-action (CTA) across the site to encourage visitors to join his email list. Building this owned audience asset is a top priority from day one.

The abstract concepts of the new brand identity must be distilled into a concrete, actionable framework. This matrix will serve as a strategic compass for all future brand activities, ensuring consistency and preventing brand drift. It becomes the single source of truth for Mr. Roushan and any potential collaborators.

## Part III: Phase 2 - The Content Engine: Building Authority at Scale (Months 3-12)


### A. Content Pillar Identification: The Core Curriculum

With the brand foundation established, the focus shifts to building authority through a systematic content strategy. The content must provide actionable frameworks and deep insights, not just surface-level opinions. This approach is modeled on the success of tactical experts like Shreyas Doshi and Lenny Rachitsky, who have built massive followings by teaching their audience *how* to think and execute, rather than just *what* to think.<sup>14</sup> The content will be organized around four core pillars derived from the Brand Identity Matrix.



* **Pillar 1: The AI Product Leader:** This pillar will focus on the practical application of Generative AI in product management. Content will include frameworks for integrating GenAI into product strategy, methods for identifying viable AI-native product opportunities, and best practices for managing AI product roadmaps and dealing with their inherent uncertainty.
* **Pillar 2: The IIM PM's Toolkit:** This pillar will leverage his elite educational background. It involves translating classic business school frameworks (e.g., Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean Strategy, Christensen's Disruptive Innovation) into practical, actionable tools specifically for product managers operating in the Indian technology context.
* **Pillar 3: Scaling for India:** Drawing directly from his experience at high-growth companies like Paytm, this pillar will offer hard-won lessons on building products for the unique complexities of the Indian market.<sup>1</sup> Topics will include navigating digital payments ecosystems, solving for last-mile logistics, and designing for diverse, multi-lingual, and economically varied user segments.
* **Pillar 4: Career Architecture:** This pillar is focused on mentorship and giving back. It will provide guidance on navigating a career in product management, from securing the first PM role to making the leap to Head of Product. It will cover topics like stakeholder management, team building, and developing leadership skills.


### B. Multi-Platform Content Strategy: The Hub-and-Spoke Model

A "create once, distribute many" approach will be employed to maximize the reach and impact of each piece of content. This hub-and-spoke model ensures that deep, valuable work is leveraged across multiple platforms.



* **The Hub (rakeshroushan.com):** The personal website's blog will be the home for long-form, evergreen "pillar" articles. These will be substantial, 2,000+ word deep dives designed to become definitive resources on their respective topics (e.g., "The Complete Guide to Product Strategy for GenAI Startups in India"). These articles will be optimized for search engines to build long-term organic traffic and authority.
* **The Spokes (LinkedIn, X):** The social platforms will serve as the primary distribution channels, used to "atomize" the pillar content into smaller, platform-native formats.
    * **LinkedIn:** As the primary channel for professional authority, LinkedIn will be used to deconstruct a single pillar article into a series of 5-7 high-value posts (e.g., text posts, carousels, polls) that will be shared over a two-week period. This high-frequency posting strategy is a proven method used by established voices like Ankur Warikoo to maintain visibility and engagement.<sup>17</sup>
    * **X (formerly Twitter):** This platform is ideal for sharing bite-sized, potent insights, engaging in real-time conversations with the global product and tech community, and sharing links back to the main blog content. The use of insightful threads to break down complex topics is a strategy that has been used to great effect by product leaders like Shreyas Doshi to build large, engaged followings.<sup>18</sup>

Successful content creators do not simply write posts; they build a content *product*. Lenny Rachitsky's newsletter is a highly structured, valuable product that his audience relies on for their professional development.<sup>19</sup> Ankur Warikoo's content ecosystem is a full-fledged product line of courses, books, and speaking tours.<sup>21</sup> Mr. Roushan must adopt this mindset, shifting from "I need to post on LinkedIn today" to "I am building a premier media product for India's product management community." This reframing elevates the standard of work. It necessitates a rigorous content calendar, a consistent and recognizable format, an unwavering focus on quality, and a clear "job-to-be-done" for every piece of content published. The ultimate goal is to become an indispensable resource, not just another voice in a crowded feed.


### C. Content Cadence and Workflow: The System for Consistency

Consistency is the most critical factor in building an audience and is often the primary point of failure for new personal brands.<sup>19</sup> A disciplined, repeatable system is non-negotiable.


#### Weekly Cadence:



* **Monday:** LinkedIn Post (Text or Carousel format) focusing on Pillar 1 (The AI Product Leader).
* **Tuesday:** X Thread that expands on a specific, nuanced point from Monday's LinkedIn post, encouraging deeper discussion.
* **Wednesday:** LinkedIn Post (Text or Poll format) focusing on Pillar 3 (Scaling for India) or Pillar 4 (Career Architecture).
* **Thursday:** A long-form pillar article is published on the blog every two weeks. On the off-weeks, a link to a curated, valuable external resource with his commentary is shared.
* **Friday:** A "Weekly Reflections" post on LinkedIn. This post should share a personal story, a key learning from the week, or a moment of vulnerability. This builds authenticity and human connection, a strategy effectively used by communicators like Ankur Warikoo.<sup>24</sup>


#### Workflow:

To ensure this cadence is sustainable, content creation must be systemized. A recurring 4-hour block should be scheduled each week for "Content Creation." During this time, the LinkedIn and X posts for the entire upcoming week can be batch-created and scheduled. A separate, dedicated block of time should be allocated for writing the bi-weekly long-form article. This systemic approach removes the friction of daily creative decisions and ensures a consistent, high-quality output.

A detailed content plan is essential to operationalize the strategy and prevent inconsistency. The following table provides a clear, actionable blueprint that removes the daily guesswork of what to post. It ensures a balanced mix of formats, platforms, and objectives, allowing Mr. Roushan to build momentum and train his audience to expect high-quality content from him on a regular basis, which is the foundation of building a loyal community.

## Part IV: Phase 3 - Influence Amplification & Strategic PR (Months 6-18)


### A. Network Cultivation: From Follower to Peer

With a foundation of consistent, high-quality content, the strategy shifts from broadcasting to engaging. The objective is to strategically cultivate relationships with the top 50 product leaders in India, many of whom are listed in resources like The Product Folks' "100 Product Managers" list <sup>26</sup>, as well as influential global figures.<sup>27</sup>

The approach must be one of a peer, not a supplicant. This involves moving beyond generic comments like "Great post!" and instead adding genuine, insightful contributions to their online discussions. A powerful technique is to reference one's own frameworks or experiences in a way that adds value to the conversation (e.g., "This is a great point on prioritization. It reminds me of a framework I developed at Paytm for balancing tech debt and new features, which I wrote about recently..."). The goal is to get on their radar as a fellow expert, which will organically lead to collaborations, speaking invitations, and other inbound opportunities.


### B. Securing High-Leverage Platforms: "Other People's Audiences" (OPA)

The most efficient way to grow an audience is to leverage existing ones. This requires a proactive public relations and outreach effort.



* **Podcast Tour:** Once Mr. Roushan has a library of 5-10 pillar articles on his blog, these articles become "credibility collateral." They serve as proof of his expertise and provide ready-made topics for discussion. He can then begin a targeted outreach campaign to appear as a guest on relevant Indian technology, business, and startup podcasts. The pitch will be highly specific, offering to discuss one of his core content pillars, providing immense value to the podcast's audience.
* **Guest Writing:** The IIM Calcutta alumni network and his existing professional connections should be leveraged to secure guest post opportunities on established tech blogs and online publications (e.g., YourStory, Inc42, ETtech). These guest posts provide powerful SEO benefits through high-authority backlinks and, more importantly, offer powerful third-party validation of his expertise.
* **Speaking Engagements:** The journey to becoming a paid speaker begins with unpaid appearances. He should start by seeking opportunities at smaller, targeted events like local product management meetups, startup incubator demo days, and guest lectures at business schools. The primary goal of these initial engagements is to build a speaker reel, gather testimonials, and refine his presentation skills. The long-term objective is to secure paid corporate speaking engagements, which is a significant monetization channel for established experts like Ankur Warikoo and Kunal Shah.<sup>28</sup>


### C. Community Building: The Transition to a Leader

Getting featured on a major podcast or in a well-known publication provides a temporary spike in visibility—this is borrowed influence. True, sustainable brand equity is built by converting that borrowed attention into an owned community. The newsletter is the critical bridge in this process. Kunal Shah's business model for CRED serves as the ultimate example of this principle in action: it is a high-trust, gated community that is monetized through value-added services.<sup>35</sup>

This means the PR strategy cannot be an end in itself. Every podcast appearance, every guest post, and every speaking engagement must include a clear and compelling call-to-action that drives the new audience back to Mr. Roushan's owned platform—his newsletter. The strategic imperative is to systematically convert followers from "rented" platforms like LinkedIn and X to an "owned" asset, the email list. This list is the foundation for all future monetization and direct communication, insulating his brand from the whims of social media algorithms.



* **The Newsletter:** The newsletter will be the primary vehicle for building a deep, lasting relationship with his most engaged followers. It must provide exclusive insights, frameworks, or personal reflections not found on his public social media channels. This exclusivity is key to making it a valuable asset worth subscribing to, a strategy central to the entire business model of creators like Lenny Rachitsky.<sup>16</sup>
* **Interactive Formats:** To foster a sense of community and direct connection, he should host monthly LinkedIn Live or X Spaces "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) sessions. These forums allow him to engage directly with his audience in real-time, answer their specific questions, and build a loyal following that feels seen and heard. This type of direct, authentic engagement is a hallmark of trusted personal brands like Ankur Warikoo's.<sup>23</sup>


## Part V: Phase 4 - Strategic Monetization Pathways (Months 12-24+)


### A. The Monetization Ladder: A Phased Rollout

The monetization strategy is designed as a ladder, with each rung building upon the authority and audience size of the previous one. This phased approach de-risks the process by aligning the offerings with the maturity of the brand. It strategically avoids the common mistake of attempting to sell a high-ticket product to a small or cold audience. This model is a synthesis of the successful strategies observed in the benchmarked thought leaders.<sup>22</sup>


### B. Tier 1 (Months 12-18): Low-Friction & Indirect Monetization

During this phase, the primary focus remains on brand building, with monetization serving as both a revenue stream and a proof-of-concept.



* **Paid Speaking Engagements:** With a portfolio of content, a growing audience, and initial speaking experience from Phase 3, he can begin to command fees for corporate talks, workshops, and conference keynotes. Speaker bureaus list fees for top-tier product experts like Shreyas Doshi in the range of $10,000-$50,000 per engagement.<sup>44</sup> Mr. Roushan can realistically start in the $1,000-$3,000 range for corporate workshops and increase his rates as his brand recognition and demand grow.
* **Paid Workshops/Webinars:** Offering 2-3 hour paid virtual workshops on hyper-specific topics from his content pillars (e.g., "A Founder's Guide to GenAI Product Strategy") is an excellent way to test the market's willingness to pay for his knowledge. These are low-risk to create and can be priced accessibly (e.g., $100-$300 per seat).
* **Indirect Monetization:** It is crucial to recognize that the most significant financial returns in this phase may be indirect. The authority and visibility generated will inevitably lead to higher-paying full-time job offers, inbound requests for board advisory positions, and unsolicited consulting opportunities. These are the most immediate and substantial financial benefits of a strong personal brand.


### C. Tier 2 (Months 18-24): High-Ticket Services

As his brand solidifies and his audience grows, he can introduce higher-value, service-based offerings.



* **1:1 Coaching/Mentorship:** Offer a limited number of high-ticket coaching packages for senior product managers looking to advance to executive roles or for early-stage founders navigating product-market fit. These engagements provide deep, personalized value and can be priced at a premium (e.g., $5,000-$15,000 for a three-month engagement).
* **Fractional CPO / Startup Advisory:** Formalize his expertise into a clear advisory offering. He can engage with 1-2 early-stage startups in a fractional CPO capacity, providing strategic guidance for a combination of monthly cash retainers and equity. This model is a common and lucrative path for experienced tech executives and leverages his deep operational experience.


### D. Tier 3 (Months 24+): Scalable Products

This is the final tier of the monetization ladder, focused on decoupling income from time by creating scalable intellectual property assets. The community and authority built in the preceding phases are non-negotiable prerequisites for success here.



* **Signature Online Course:** The pinnacle of knowledge monetization is the creation of a comprehensive, cohort-based online course. A potential title could be "The AI Product Accelerator: Building & Scaling AI Products in India." This follows the highly successful models of Ankur Warikoo, who has built an entire education business around his courses <sup>22</sup>, and Shreyas Doshi, who commands premium prices ($700-$2,500) for his specialized courses on Maven.<sup>42</sup> A cohort-based model allows for premium pricing and fosters a strong sense of community among students.
* **Paid Community/Mastermind:** For his most advanced audience members, he can create a private, application-only community for senior product leaders and founders. This would be a high-trust environment for peer-to-peer learning and networking, facilitated by him. This model generates recurring subscription revenue and creates an unparalleled professional asset, similar in principle to the exclusive, high-trust community that Kunal Shah built with CRED.<sup>36</sup>


## Part VI: The 24-Month Implementation Roadmap & KPIs

This roadmap operationalizes the entire strategy into a clear, time-bound plan with measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress and ensure accountability.


### A. Quarters 1-2 (Months 1-6): Foundation & Authority



* **Actions:** Relaunch the personal website (rakeshroushan.com). Fully optimize the LinkedIn profile with the new brand identity. Finalize the Brand Identity Matrix. Establish the weekly content creation and distribution cadence. Publish the first 6-8 long-form pillar articles on the blog. Begin the strategic networking process by engaging with the top 50 influencers list.
* **KPIs:** Achieve website traffic of over 1,000 unique visitors per month. Increase LinkedIn follower count by over 20%. Establish a top 3 Google ranking for the search query "Rakesh Roushan Product Manager GenAI". Log 2-3 meaningful, value-add interactions with top-tier influencers per week.


### B. Quarters 3-4 (Months 7-12): Amplification & Early Monetization



* **Actions:** Launch the weekly newsletter and actively promote it as the primary CTA. Develop a standardized pitch deck and begin outreach for 5 podcast appearances. Secure and publish 2 guest posts on reputable tech publications. Host the first LinkedIn Live AMA session. Develop, market, and deliver the first paid virtual workshop.
* **KPIs:** Grow newsletter subscribers to over 1,000. Secure 3 podcast guest appearances. Attract over 50 paid attendees for the first workshop. Secure the first paid speaking engagement.


### C. Quarters 5-6 (Months 13-18): Community & High-Ticket Services
