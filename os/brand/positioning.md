# Positioning (single source of truth)

## One-liner

**I build AI-native products and help founders ship faster with execution systems that actually work.**

## Category + niche

- Category: Product leadership / AI product strategy / founder execution
- Niche: Building AI-native products for India-scale markets + systems for execution

## Who (ICP)

- Primary: Early-stage founders building AI-powered products (0→1 and 1→100)
- Secondary: Mid-career PMs (5-10 yrs) looking to level up into product leadership or go founder-mode

## Pain (what they struggle with)

- Can't ship fast enough — stuck in planning loops
- No execution framework — winging it week to week
- Don't know how to integrate AI into their product without it being a gimmick
- Scaling for India's complexity (payments, languages, infra) is brutal
- Can't prioritize across 10 competing ideas

## Promise (outcome)

- A repeatable system to go from idea → live product → revenue in weeks, not quarters
- Clarity on what to build, what to kill, and what to double down on
- Practical AI integration that creates real user value

## Mechanism (how you do it)

- First-principles frameworks (IIM Calcutta strategy + real-world execution)
- Execution cadence (daily scoreboard → weekly review → monthly pivot-or-persist)
- Distribution thinking (compounding channels, not one-off launches)
- Near-zero infra playbook (Cloudflare edge stack, 95%+ margins)

## Proof (why believe you)

- IIM Calcutta (MBA)
- Led business product at Paytm Soundbox (India's #1 offline payments device)
- Managed 500+ cr topline marketing at Airtel Karnataka
- Built 0→1 fintech at Ninjacart
- Currently running 20+ AI SaaS products through Roushan Venture Studio
- Founded AudioPod AI (unified AI audio workstation) and UnQuest AI (knowledge management)
