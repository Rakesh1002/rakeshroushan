# Story (narrative assets)

## Core thesis

The best products aren't built by the smartest people in the room — they're built by the fastest learners with the best execution systems.

## Origin story (3 scenes)

1) **Before:** Spent 6+ years in corporate India — Airtel, Ninjacart, Paytm — learning how large-scale products actually work. Managed 500+ cr toplines, built 0→1 fintech products, led business product for Paytm Soundbox. Learned strategy at IIM Calcutta. But always felt the gap between "knowing what to build" and "actually shipping it" was where most people (and companies) failed.

2) **Turning point:** Left Paytm in late 2023 to build UnQuest AI — an AI knowledge management platform. For the first time, wore every hat: product, engineering, design, GTM. Realized the constraint was never the idea — it was the operating system around the builder. The cadence, the prioritization, the distribution thinking. Started building execution frameworks that let a solo founder ship at the speed of a 10-person team.

3) **Now:** Running Roushan Venture Studio — a portfolio of 20+ AI-powered SaaS products built on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure with near-zero infra costs. Also building AudioPod AI (the Canva for Audio). Sharing everything learned: the frameworks, the failures, the systems. The goal is simple — help founders and PMs ship better products, faster.

## "Why now" story

Three forces are converging:
- **AI is a commodity** — inference costs are plummeting, open models are good enough, the moat is now in product + distribution, not model training
- **India is ready** — UPI, Aadhaar, and cheap mobile data have created a billion-user digital market that's still massively underserved by quality AI products
- **Edge infra is free** — Cloudflare Workers AI, R2, D1 mean a solo builder can ship globally at 95%+ margins

The window for solo builders and small teams to capture massive value has never been wider. But only if they have the execution system to move fast enough.

## POVs you'll repeat (3–7)

- Execution systems beat talent. Every time.
- The best framework is the one you actually use daily.
- AI products that just "add AI" fail. AI-native means the product doesn't exist without AI.
- Speed is a strategy, not just a tactic. Ship weekly or you're planning, not building.
- Distribution is the product. If nobody sees it, it doesn't matter how good it is.
- India-scale is its own discipline — you can't copy-paste Silicon Valley playbooks.
- Near-zero infra costs change the math on what's worth building.

Rakesh Roushan is a product leader, founder, and venture builder operating at the intersection of AI, product strategy, and execution speed. Based in Bengaluru, India, he runs Roushan Venture Studio — a portfolio of 20+ AI-powered SaaS products built on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure with near-zero operating costs.

Rakesh holds an MBA from IIM Calcutta and spent 6+ years in senior product and growth roles across India's top tech companies. At Paytm, he led business product for Soundbox — India's most ubiquitous offline payments device. At Bharti Airtel, he managed 500+ cr topline marketing for Karnataka, driving digital acquisition and brand strategy. At Ninjacart, he built 0→1 fintech initiatives, creating new revenue streams in agri-tech. He also worked with Singtel in Singapore on prepaid product marketing across Southeast Asian markets.

In late 2023, Rakesh made the leap to full-time founder with UnQuest AI, building an AI-powered knowledge management platform. This was followed by AudioPod AI — a unified AI audio workstation positioned as "Canva for Audio," making professional audio tools accessible to all content creators.

Through Roushan Venture Studio, Rakesh is now building across seven verticals: VoiceAI, SearchAI, ContentAI, DevToolsAI, BizToolsAI, ImageAI, and operations. His approach combines rigorous strategic frameworks (from IIM) with a relentless execution cadence — daily scoreboard, weekly reviews, monthly portfolio rebalancing.

Rakesh shares his frameworks, systems, and lessons publicly — covering topics like AI-native product development, execution systems for solo founders, distribution-first thinking, and scaling for India's unique complexity. His philosophy is rooted in speed over perfection, systems over talent, and distribution as a core product feature.

He believes the window for small teams to build massive value in AI has never been wider — and writes to help others seize it.
