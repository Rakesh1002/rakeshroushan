# Audience (who you serve)

## Primary persona

- Title: Early-stage AI founder / solo builder
- Context: Technical or product-minded, building their first or second startup, trying to ship an AI product fast with a small team (1-3 people). Based in India or building for Indian/global markets.
- Top 5 pains:
  1. Too many ideas, no system to prioritize and execute
  2. Spending months building before validating — shipping too slow
  3. AI features feel gimmicky — can't figure out how to make AI core to the product
  4. Infra costs eating into runway — AWS/GCP bills spiraling
  5. No distribution strategy — building in a vacuum, zero traffic
- Top 5 desired outcomes:
  1. Ship an MVP in days, not months
  2. Clear weekly execution cadence that compounds
  3. AI integration that creates real, defensible user value
  4. Near-zero infra costs so they can bootstrap longer
  5. Distribution flywheel that brings users organically
- Objections / skepticism: "20 products sounds scattered" / "Can one person really build all this?"
- Words they use: "ship", "validate", "MRR", "ramen profitable", "edge functions", "zero to one"

## Secondary persona

- Title: Mid-career PM (5-10 yrs) at Indian tech company
- Context: Solid IC contributor, thinking about going founder-mode or leveling up to Head of Product. Wants strategic frameworks, not just tactical tips.
- Top 5 pains:
  1. Stuck in feature factory mode — no strategic impact
  2. Can't get buy-in for AI initiatives from leadership
  3. No clear path from Senior PM → Head of Product
  4. Overwhelmed by AI hype — doesn't know what's real vs noise
  5. Wants to build something of their own but afraid to leave stability
- Top 5 desired outcomes:
  1. Strategic frameworks they can apply at work immediately
  2. Confidence to lead AI product initiatives
  3. Career clarity — stay or go founder
  4. A community of serious product people (not LinkedIn fluff)
  5. Playbooks for the 0→1 journey if they decide to leap
