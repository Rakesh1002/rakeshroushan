# The "AI Native" PM Skills Matrix

The job description for a Product Manager hasn't changed much in 10 years.
SQL. User Research. A/B Testing. Roadmapping.

**But the job itself has changed completely.**

If you are still optimizing for "writing better tickets," you are optimizing for a world that is disappearing. The AI-Native PM isn't just a PM who uses ChatGPT. They are a PM who understands how to _architect_ products where the core value prop is probabilistic, not deterministic.

Here is the new skills matrix for 2026.

## 1. From "SQL" to "Context Engineering"

**Old World:** You write a query to find out what happened.
**New World:** You design the _context window_ to make the right thing happen.

The most valuable data skill today isn't retrieving rows; it's understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). How do you feed the right user history into the LLM at the right moment?

## 2. From "Acceptance Criteria" to "Eval Sets"

**Old World:** If X, then Y. (Deterministic)
**New World:** In 95% of cases, the response should be roughly Z. (Probabilistic)

You can't write a Jira ticket that says "The AI should be funny." You need to build an _evaluation set_—a spreadsheet of 100 inputs and "gold standard" outputs. Your job is to define "good."

## 3. From "A/B Testing" to "Model Arb"

**Old World:** Test Blue button vs. Red button.
**New World:** Test GPT-4o vs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs. Llama 3 (70B).

The biggest lever for cost and latency isn't code optimization; it's model selection. An AI PM needs to know when to use a $0.01 model and when to burn cash on the $10 model.

**The takeaway:**
Don't learn to code (unless you enjoy it). Learn to _architect systems_ that think.
