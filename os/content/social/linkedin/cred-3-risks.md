# The 3 Types of Product Risk: A CRED Case Study

**Hook:**
Is CRED a business or just a burning pile of VC cash?
Let's analyze it using the "3 Risks" Framework.

**Slide 1: The Framework**
Every product faces 3 existential risks:

1. **Desirability Risk**: Do they want it?
2. **Feasibility Risk**: Can we build it?
3. **Viability Risk**: Should we build it? (Can we make money?)

**Slide 2: Desirability (High)**
CRED nailed this.
They turned "paying bills" (a chore) into a "status signal" (a luxury).

- 13M+ Users (FY24).
- 55% growth in Payment Value.
  _Verdict: People WANT it._

**Slide 3: Feasibility (Medium)**
Technically, it's just a fintech app. The tech isn't the risk.
The risk is "Partnership Feasibility".
Can they convince 2,000+ brands to give away free stuff forever?
_Verdict: Hard, but they are doing it._

**Slide 4: Viability (The Danger Zone)**
Here is where it gets scary.

- Valuation dropped from $6.4B to $3.5B (2025).
- Operating losses are shrinking (down 41%), but they are still losing ₹609 Cr.
  The question isn't "Can they grow?"
  The question is "Can they monetize trust before they run out of runway?"

**Slide 5: The Lesson**
Most startups fail at Desirability (building things nobody wants).
Scale-ups fail at Viability (building things that don't make money).
Know which risk you are fighting today.
