# Latency is the New Downtime

**Hook:**
In the GenAI era, "slow" is the same as "broken".

**Body:**
We used to optimize for features. "Does it work?"
Now we must optimize for speed. "Does it work _now_?"

The data is brutal:

- **3.94% Monthly Churn** for ChatGPT-like apps (vs 0.86% for traditional SaaS).
- **The 16% Rule**: Every additional second of latency reduces customer satisfaction by 16%.
- A 3-second delay cuts your user satisfaction in **half**.

Think about that.
You can have the smartest model in the world (GPT-4o), but if it takes 5 seconds to think, your user has already tabbed away to Google.

**The Shift:**
We are moving from "Model Quality" wars to "Inference Speed" wars.
Groq, Cerebras, and edge-AI are not "optimizations". They are survival mechanisms.

**The Lesson:**
If you are building an AI wrapper, your moat isn't the prompt.
Your moat is how fast you can deliver the answer.
