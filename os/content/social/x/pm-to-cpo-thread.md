Stop asking "How do I become a CPO?"
Start asking "How do I stop thinking like a PM?"

The gap between Senior PM and Head of Product isn't about better execution. It's about better _allocation_.

Here is the mental shift you need to make 🧵👇

2/
**The PM Mindset:** "How do I ship this feature on time?"
**The CPO Mindset:** "Should we even build this feature, or should we buy a competitor?"

PMs optimize _output_.
CPOs optimize _outcomes_ per dollar spent.

3/
**The PM Mindset:** "I need more engineers."
**The CPO Mindset:** "How do I increase the leverage of the engineers I already have?"

If your answer to every problem is "more headcount," you are not ready for leadership.

4/
**The PM Mindset:** "The users want X."
**The CPO Mindset:** "The business needs Y to survive the next 2 quarters."

Sometimes, you have to ship things users _don't_ ask for (like enterprise controls) to unlock the revenue that keeps the lights on.

5/
The hardest part?
Letting go of the craft.

You will write fewer specs. You will touch fewer pixels.
Your "product" is no longer the app. Your product is the _team_ that builds the app.

If the team works, the product works.
