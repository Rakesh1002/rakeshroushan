Junior PMs build Features.
Senior PMs build Loops.

If you want to get promoted in 2025, stop optimizing "Output" and start optimizing "Compounding".

Here is the difference 🧵👇

**The Feature Mindset (Linear):**
"I need to build a Referral Program."
-> Build 'Invite' button.
-> User clicks invite.
-> Send email.
-> Done.

Result: You get a one-time spike, then it dies.

3/
**The Loop Mindset (Circular):**
"I need to build a Growth Engine."
-> User invites friend.
-> Friend joins.
-> Friend gets _immediate value_ (Activation).
-> Friend is prompted to invite _their_ friend to get _more_ value.
-> Cycle repeats.

Result: It grows while you sleep.

4/
Pinterest is the king of loops.
User finds image on Google (Acquisition).
User saves image to board (Activation).
Google indexes new board (SEO Loop).
New user finds board on Google (Acquisition).

They didn't build "features". They built a self-perpetuating engine.

How to spot a Feature vs. a Loop:

- Does it have a beginning and an end? -> **Feature.**
- Does the output of one cycle become the input of the next? -> **Loop.**

6/
Stop shipping dead ends.
Start connecting the pipes.

Your product should work _for_ you, not just _because_ of you.
