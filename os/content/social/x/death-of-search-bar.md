The Search Bar is dying. 💀
And the Hamburger Menu is next.

We are moving from "Navigation" (clicking menus) to "Intention" (typing what we want).

Here is why your product design is about to become obsolete 🧵👇

2/
For 20 years, UX design was about "Maps".
We built sitemaps, navigation bars, and breadcrumbs.
We forced users to learn _our_ mental model to find _their_ answer.

"Click Settings > Account > Privacy > Change Password."

3/
GenAI flips this.
The user doesn't want to learn your map. They just want to state their intent.

"Change my password."

The interface of the future isn't a map. It's a concierge.

4/
Look at Perplexity.
There is no "News" tab or "Images" tab.
There is just a box that asks: "What do you want to know?"

The friction of _finding_ the feature is gone.
The only friction left is _articulating_ the intent.

5/
This kills the "Feature Bloat" problem.
In the old world, you added buttons for every new feature. The UI got cluttered.
In the new world, you add _capabilities_ to the model. The UI stays the same.

A simple text box can scale to 1,000 features without adding a single pixel of clutter.

6/
The "Command K" revolution was just the warm-up.
The future is "No UI".

The best interface is the one that isn't there.
Stop designing screens. Start designing conversations.
