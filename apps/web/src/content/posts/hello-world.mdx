Everyone thinks I'm crazy for trying to build 20 products simultaneously. They might be right. But here's why I'm doing it anyway.

## The Thesis

Three forces are converging right now:

1. **AI inference is becoming free.** Cloudflare Workers AI gives us Whisper, Llama 3, FLUX — all at zero marginal cost with our credits.
2. **Edge infrastructure eliminates ops.** No servers to manage. No scaling to worry about. Deploy to 300+ cities globally with one command.
3. **Distribution is the only moat.** When anyone can build an AI feature, the winners are those who reach users first and retain them best.

This means a solo builder with the right execution system can test 20 product hypotheses in the time it used to take to launch one.

## The Execution System

I don't wing it. Every week follows the same cadence:

- **Monday:** VoiceAI products (AudioPod, AudioWhisper, AudioTele)
- **Tuesday:** SearchAI products (UnSearch, Competely, CheckADA)
- **Wednesday:** ContentAI products (Tweety, Writely, Screenly)
- **Thursday:** DevToolsAI products (ShipQuest, FlareMail)
- **Friday:** BizToolsAI products (WhatsBy, Legally)
- **Saturday:** ImageAI products (Aura)
- **Sunday:** Ops day — review metrics, kill underperformers, double down on winners

## The Math

With $250K in Cloudflare credits and near-zero infra costs, we're running at 95%+ gross margins. That means even a product doing $2K MRR is profitable from day one.

20 products at $5K MRR each = $100K MRR. Not all will hit — most won't. But the ones that do will compound.

## What I've Learned So Far

**Speed beats perfection.** Every time. The product I spent 3 months perfecting (UnQuest AI) got less traction than products I shipped in a weekend.

**Distribution is the product.** If nobody sees it, it doesn't matter how good it is. I now spend 50% of my time on GTM, not building.

**Kill fast.** If a product doesn't show signs of life in 2 weeks, archive it and move on. Sentimentality is the enemy of velocity.

This is the journey. Follow along as I share the frameworks, the failures, and the wins.
