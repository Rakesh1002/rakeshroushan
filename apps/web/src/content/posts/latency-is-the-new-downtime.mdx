In the GenAI era, "slow" is the same as "broken".

We used to optimize for features. "Does it work?"
Now we must optimize for speed. "Does it work _now_?"

The data is brutal:

- **3.94% Monthly Churn** for ChatGPT-like apps (vs 0.86% for traditional SaaS).
- **The 16% Rule**: Every additional second of latency reduces customer satisfaction by 16%.
- A 3-second delay cuts your user satisfaction in **half**.

Think about that.
You can have the smartest model in the world (GPT-4o), but if it takes 5 seconds to think, your user has already tabbed away to Google.

## The Shift

We are moving from "Model Quality" wars to "Inference Speed" wars.
Groq, Cerebras, and edge-AI are not "optimizations". They are survival mechanisms.

## The Lesson

If you are building an AI wrapper, your moat isn't the prompt.
Your moat is how fast you can deliver the answer.

This is why we build everything on Cloudflare Workers at Roushan Venture Studio. Edge compute isn't a nice-to-have — it's the difference between a user who stays and a user who bounces.
