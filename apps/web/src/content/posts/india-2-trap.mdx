Most Indian startups fail because they build for "India 1" but price for "India 2".

"India 1" is 100M users. They look like the West. They have iPhones, credit cards, and speak English.
"India 2" is the next 200M. They have Androids, use UPI, and think in vernacular.

I saw this firsthand at Paytm.

When we built features for the top 1%, engagement soared, but retention flatlined. Why? Because the top 1% are fickle. They have 50 other apps.

But when we solved a boring, unsexy problem for India 2 — like **Soundbox** for merchants who couldn't read confirmation screens?

Usage exploded. Sticky. Essential.

## The Lesson

If you want prestige, build for India 1.
If you want a unicorn, solve a trust problem for India 2.

The merchants using Soundbox didn't care about our UI. They cared that they could _hear_ that the payment went through while their hands were busy making chai. That's product-market fit you can't fake.

Which "India 2" problem are you ignoring because it's not sexy?
