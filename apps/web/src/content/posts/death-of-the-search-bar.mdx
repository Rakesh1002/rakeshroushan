The Search Bar is dying. And the Hamburger Menu is next.

We are moving from "Navigation" (clicking menus) to "Intention" (typing what we want).

## The Old World

For 20 years, UX design was about "Maps". We built sitemaps, navigation bars, and breadcrumbs. We forced users to learn _our_ mental model to find _their_ answer.

"Click Settings > Account > Privacy > Change Password."

## The New World

GenAI flips this. The user doesn't want to learn your map. They just want to state their intent.

"Change my password."

The interface of the future isn't a map. It's a concierge.

## Look at Perplexity

There is no "News" tab or "Images" tab. There is just a box that asks: "What do you want to know?"

The friction of _finding_ the feature is gone. The only friction left is _articulating_ the intent.

## The Feature Bloat Solution

In the old world, you added buttons for every new feature. The UI got cluttered.
In the new world, you add _capabilities_ to the model. The UI stays the same.

A simple text box can scale to 1,000 features without adding a single pixel of clutter.

## The Bottom Line

The "Command K" revolution was just the warm-up. The future is "No UI".

The best interface is the one that isn't there. Stop designing screens. Start designing conversations.
