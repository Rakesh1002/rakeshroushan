title: "The 'Chief AI Officer' is a Temporary Role"

It's happening again.
In 2010, every company hired a "Chief Digital Officer."
In 2015, they hired a "Chief Innovation Officer."
In 2024, they are hiring a "Chief AI Officer" (CAIO).

Gartner predicts that by 2025, 70% of CDOs (Chief Data Officers) will absorb this role. Forrester says CIOs will take the rest.

Why? **Because AI is not a department.**
AI is a horizontal layer that cuts through everything — Product, Engineering, Marketing, HR.

When you create a standalone "AI Department," you create a silo. You create a team of researchers looking for problems to solve, instead of business leaders using AI to solve existing problems.

## The AI-Native Organization

It doesn't have a Chief AI Officer. It has:

1. **A CPO** who knows how to design probabilistic products.
2. **A CTO** who knows how to manage inference costs and model evaluations.
3. **A CFO** who knows that "Headcount" is no longer a proxy for "Output."

## My advice to aspiring leaders

Don't chase the "Head of AI" title. It has a shelf life of 3-5 years.
Instead, become the Product Leader who is undeniable because they understand AI better than the engineers.

The future belongs to the _integrators_, not the _isolators_.
