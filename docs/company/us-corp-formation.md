#### Step 3: Complete 83(b) Election (CRITICAL - Within 30 Days)

```
The 83(b) election tells the IRS you want to pay taxes on your
founder shares NOW (at near-zero value) rather than when they vest.

Without this, you could owe massive taxes when shares become valuable.

Steps:
1. Fill out 83(b) form (Stripe Atlas provides template)
2. Sign and date
3. Mail to IRS within 30 days of stock purchase:

   Internal Revenue Service
   [Your regional IRS center]

4. Send certified mail with return receipt
5. Keep copy for your records
6. Give copy to company
```

```
Stripe Atlas does this automatically, but if manual:

1. Go to irs.gov
2. Apply online for EIN (Form SS-4)
3. Answer questions about the business
4. Receive EIN immediately
5. Download confirmation letter
```

#### Step 5: Open Bank Account

**Recommended: Mercury Bank**

```
1. Apply at mercury.com
2. Upload:
   - Certificate of Incorporation
   - EIN confirmation
   - Passport/ID
   - Proof of address
3. Initial deposit: $0 minimum
4. Receive debit card
```

**Mercury Features**:

- No monthly fees
- No minimum balance
- Virtual cards for subscriptions
- Team access
- API for accounting
- Treasury for interest on balance

#### Step 6: Set Up Stripe for Payments

```
1. Create Stripe account or upgrade existing
2. Complete business verification
3. Connect to Mercury for payouts
4. Enable:
   - Stripe Payments
   - Stripe Billing (subscriptions)
   - Stripe Tax (automatic sales tax)
```

#### Step 7: Purchase Founder Shares

```
1. Sign Stock Purchase Agreement (from Stripe Atlas)
2. Pay $800 to company (Mercury account)
   - Write check or transfer with memo "Stock Purchase"
3. Company issues 8,000,000 shares to you
