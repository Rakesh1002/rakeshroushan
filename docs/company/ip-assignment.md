# Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement

## Overview

This document provides the framework for IP ownership and assignment between entities in the RR Holdings structure.

---

## IP Ownership Principles

### Golden Rule
**All intellectual property must be owned by the US parent company (RR Holdings Inc.)**

This ensures:
1. Clean cap table for US investors
2. Unified IP ownership across all startups
3. Protection of core assets in favorable jurisdiction
4. Simplified licensing and commercialization
