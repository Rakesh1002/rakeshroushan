## Risk Mitigation

### What If I Fall Behind?

**Scenario: Fewer launches than planned**

- Simplify product scope
- Use more templates/boilerplates
- Launch MVPs, not polished products

**Scenario: Low conversion to paid**

- A/B test pricing
- Add free trial
- Improve onboarding
- Talk to users

**Scenario: Burnout**

- Take 1 full day off per week
- Automate more
- Hire VA for support
- Lower daily targets temporarily

### Contingency Plans

| Issue                    | Response                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Legal delays             | Continue with personal entity temporarily |
| Payment processor issues | Add LemonSqueezy as backup                |
| Server issues            | Multi-cloud (CF + DO + Vercel)            |
| No revenue by Day 30     | Pivot to B2B consulting while building    |
